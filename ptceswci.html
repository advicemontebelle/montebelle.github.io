                            <h2 class="osLight">An effective campaign in the 1990s used an average of three media channels; in 2010 it used seven.
We can infer that campaigns are using more channels by spending less on each. Low weight of activity
per channel reduces effectiveness, but this can be redressed by content. Campaigns that win both
creative and effectiveness awards are more likely to appeal to the emotions and are also more likely to
create brand buzz. In the ‘fourth age’ of creative integration, tasks are customised around ‘lived’
customer journeys; the focus is on the channels that actually matter; and we define roles for
communications, not just messages.</h2>
                            <p>Today's most effective campaigns use twice as many channels as in the
1990s, but using multiple media specialists can cause disjointed,
confusing advertising.</p>
                            <p>An average effective campaign in the 1990s used three media channels. Effective campaigns in 2010 used
seven channels.
It is highly unlikely, to put it mildly, that brand communication budgets have more than doubled in real terms over
this period. The implication is that campaigns are using more channels by spending less on each. Is this a good
trade?
Maybe not. True, today's target consumer is more likely to be surrounded by media targeting than in the 1990s.
The campaign is waiting for them wherever they turn. But that does not mean it will be more effective.</p>
                            <blockquote>It turns out that

the optimum number of channels per campaign was three (or four, for brands with large budgets).The success
rate for campaigns using one channel was 59%, rising to 74% for three channel campaigns. But the success
rate for five channel campaigns fell to 57%, slightly below the one-channel success rate. In other words,
focusing on a few channels is more sales-effective than stretching the budget across too many touchpoints.</blockquote>

opportunity</h2>

                            <p class="osLight">Why are campaigns that use more than three channels less likely to be effective? There's been  
some suggested hypotheses, though they do not seem entirely convincing. One was diminishing returns in terms of
coverage. Fair enough, but there may be frequency gains, which would be expected to increase effectiveness,
rather than reduce it. Or was it because of higher production costs in relation to media spend? So, why were
three-channel campaigns more effective than one-channel? It's a bit of a mystery.</p>
                            <p>There are two other factors that might help explain why campaigns using many channels are less likely to be
effective: a low weight of activity per channel; and the extent to which multi-channel campaigns are integrated in
terms of content. </p>
                            <p>There are two recent pieces of evidence about the importance of weight, beyond the observation that brands
with large budgets succeed with four channels, rather than three. Market share typically increases with high share of
voice, and decreases with low share of voice; that is to say, when the brand's share of voice is smaller than its
share of market. Secondly, a parallel, independent study by Nielsen found the same relationship in a different
database  of 123 brands across 30 packaged goods categories. The evidence strongly suggests that brands that spend too
little per channel, relative to their market penetration, struggle to grow. </p>
                            <p>But some do. There is more to effectiveness than weight alone. content matters too. In fact, content matters so
much, it can compensate for low weight. campaigns that win both creative and effectiveness awards share two characteristics.
First, they are more likely to appeal to the emotions. logic persuades, but emotions motivate. Second, they are
more likely to create brand buzz. It is known that famous campaigns create PR for the brand, but in the new
communications era of consumer-generated content and social media, this benefit is magnified.The campaign
gets loved in Facebook groups, discussed on blogs, forums and chatrooms, and imitated on YouTube.The result
is that the brand is seen as the most authoritative in the category; it defines the category in perception. </p>
                            <p>For the same weight (defined as share of voice relative to share of market), campaigns with this type of 'creative'
content were 11 times more likely to be effective. They generated almost six percentage points of market share
growth per unit weight on average, while the other campaigns generated only half a percentage point of market
share growth per unit weight. </p>
                            <p>So, content really matters. In today's seven-channel campaigns, there are, of course, seven pieces of content to
be produced. It was hard enough to integrate the content of three-channel campaigns in the 1990s, so seven is
much harder. Some clients solve this difficulty by commissioning all communications from one agency group;
integration then becomes the agency's problem. But most do not. Rather, they buy communications from a
variety of niche specialists in addition to advertising from their main creative agency. clients might buy digital
from a specialist digital agency, retail activation from a specialist retail agency, etc. </p>
                            <p>Using specialists in each field seems to makes sense, but there may be a hidden drawback. Multiple
communication suppliers can compound the problem of content integration. Each agency fights its corner in
terms of origination – it has to, or it may lose income. The danger is that channel tails may end up wagging the
brand dog. The campaign could become a Frankenstein's monster, made up of bits and pieces from various
channels jumbled together any old how. There can be no synergistic benefit from adding more channels to the
campaign unless all content is aligned. </p>
