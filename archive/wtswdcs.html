                        <div class="post-content">
                           
                            <blockquote>A common problem within so much of our industry is the proliferation of 'fat' words; words that are bandied about
to sound important or knowledgeable but which can have as many different interpretations and definitions as
people sitting in the meeting. 'Strategy' is certainly one of them; as is 'insight' and certainly 'idea'. As someone
working in communications, the irony should not be lost on you. What do you actually mean when you say
them? Have you assumed that everyone will know what you mean – whereas in fact your audience or reader's
definition of the word 'strategy' may be quite different from yours. A shared vocabulary is key. </blockquote>

<p>A revealing exercise is to retrofit the objectives and strategies on your competitor's campaigns. Do the others in
the room agree with not just the interpretation but also the definitions? It is vital to know the difference between
a strategy and an objective. It is surprising to me how often people conflate the two. Obviously one follows on
from the other, but you can't develop a strategy until you have identified your objectives. One is what you want
to achieve, the other is how you are going to achieve it. </p>

<p>The discipline of 'strategic planning' has taken a battering of late; more short-term results demanded, growth-
hacking experimentation, ever-faster turnarounds expected, less mastery among practitioners, ever-present

budget restrictions, the proliferation of stakeholders, 'brand' becoming a dirty word, the threat of the
management consultancies, the incessant spouting from the big data fire hydrant and so on. It's a worrisome
situation in an increasingly complex marketing landscape, where long-term revenue and brand creation are
being sacrificed for short-term tactics due to the lack of a thoughtful champion. </p>

<p>Account planners themselves now come with numerous new prefixes: digital planner, UX planner, social planner,

PR planner, creative planner, data planner, local planner and so on, not to mention the more mainstream all-
rounder, brand or strategic planner. This proliferation of titles in our shape-shifting industry has meant that

alongside the broad craft skills, a raft of new specialisms (and their respective agencies) has emerged. But are
they strategic or just tactical executors of the core approach in a particular channel? How many 'planners' should

there be strategising on a client project? </p>

<p>Fortunately, there are certain aspects of the planner's craft, regardless of job title or specific channel focus,
which have endured since those original 1960's pioneers of account planning: </p>

<p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Identifying and championing human insight: How do everyday folk live with, use, respond and relate to
the products, brands and messages we put out there? </li>
        <li>Applying that insight: Using those insights to innovate services, products and brand offerings, not just
multi-channel communications ideas. </li>
        <li>Trawling and translating the data: Interpreting information – nowadays from myriad sources beyond
market research alone – to better understand how and why people are thinking, feeling and behaving as
they do, and establish the relative effectiveness and value of any messaging. </li>
        <li>Catalysing connections and collaboration: Connecting the multi-disciplinary teams and agencies hired
by the client – from mobile techies, media planners, SEO experts, research executives, website designers,
UX strategists, design creatives etc, as well as your fellow strategists. </li>
        <li>Developing communications strategies: Using all of the above skills to develop communications
strategies that deliver sustainable growth to the client's business. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Thus, being able to think (plan) strategically is a key skill. It sets good planners apart from mere (tactical,
execution-driven) mortals. We all need to be excellent strategic thinkers, not only to keep our clients' business
ahead of their competitors, but also to earn and keep a place for our own agencies and our sector at the top
table when advising clients. </p>

                            </div>
                            <h2></h2>

                            <p>There are six key strategic skills that I look for in a planner: </p>

<p>
    <ul> 
        <li>1. Natural curiosity: Planners should be curious for just about anything, but not in the 'butterfly' mind sense.</li>
         <li>2. Rigorous thinking: An ability to worry at a topic until it's been cracked.</li>
          <li>3. Insightfulness: This is indicative of an ability to look at a problem from many sides. </li>
          <li>4. Empathy: This goes hand-in-hand with insightfulness. </li>
          <li>5. Problem-solving practicality: Planners must demonstrate a practical streak – striving for a viable solution
is more desirable than an academic, intellectually stimulating angle that is simply not executable. </li>
          <li>6. A colourful imagination: It's no good just looking to the past for the answer, planners need kaleidoscopic
minds to help see around corners too. So, parallel use of both left and right brain, and analytical and
imaginative thinking will sort the strategic wheat from the tactical chaff, and be the difference between
wannabe and strategic planner. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> This is a bit of a tall order perhaps, especially for a junior planner or a graduate trainee, as much of this comes
with experience. My advice to anyone looking to transfer to planning or get an upgrade is to arm yourself with a
set of strategic principles, a step-by-step process, and some tools and techniques that you can apply to just
about any marketing situation or brand, to render yourself invaluable.</p>

<p> Knowing where you want to be is the first essential step. You can't define the best role for communication (and
creativity within it) unless you really understand the business context behind your brand plan. You need to do
your homework and ground the project in the business reality of the brand. You need to identify the challenges it

is facing and the business goals and strategies designed to address or redress them by the Board and CFO.</p>

<p>Figure out why your marketing client thinks these goals are important, whether it is to create a good return for
shareholders in the short term or building long-term, future-proof, brand-led customer relationships. Establish
what success looks like and define it quite precisely. From there you should be able to identify the purpose of
the brand, the kind of relationship the brand has with its customers and, from that, the role that communications
can play in helping the brand deliver against its objectives. Or, if indeed, whether communications can help at
all. At this point, you can start developing your creative strategy. </p>
