                            <blockquote>This seminal article is based on the the text of a speech given by Stephen King at the 1970 Advertising
Association Conference, with the theme of "Sharpen up or shut up". It looks at the development of the
brand and what can be learnt from its history, what makes a brand successful, what role does
advertising play and how can this be applied to marketing brands in the 1970s. </blockquote>

<p><p>By the late 19th century, when brands started to emerge, wholesalers had become the dominating force in the
marketing of manufactured goods. These wholesalers were more than just a link between buyers and sellers.
Retailers chose from what the wholesaler had in stock, and the wholesaler specified what the manufacturers
should make—a position of some power. In this situation of competitive tender the manufacturer's profit
depended mostly on sheer production efficiency. There was little scope for building up margins by providing a
unique product. It was nearer to commodity marketing. Then, as manufactured products became more
complicated and as the benefits of large-scale production became apparent, the need arose to invest in
expensive plant. But this was very risky in the competitive tender situation. Manufacturers got over the problem
gradually through the use of patents. And gradually brand names spread to non-patented goods. This was of
course opposed fiercely by the wholesalers, but their position was weakening somewhat through competition
among themselves.</p></p>

<p>The next step was to safeguard the manufacturer's position by applying pressure on the wholesaler from the
other end. Hence advertising—the direct link with the buying public. The point is that at this time the basic
motive for advertising was to stabilise demand, thus allowing regular large-scale production, free from the whims
of the wholesaler. Partly because of this the advertising tended to be based on the idea of reliability and
guaranteed quality. (It was of course partly because reliable quality was still rather rare.)</p>

<p>The next stage developed from the first breaking of the chains—a period of manufacturer domination that lasted
from about 1900 to 1960.</p>
                            <div class="image-block">
                                <img src="images/questionmark.jpg" alt="blog image">
                                <div class="ib-title"><span class="osLight">Brands Are What?</span></div>
                            </div>
                            <h2 class="osLight">Brands Are What?</h2>
                            <p>It was a period of great concentration in numbers of manufacturers—from hundreds or even thousands in some
product fields to the oligopoly situation we see so often today. The brand was used to concentrate demand on a
relatively small number of lines, and the basis of growing profits became economies of scale—in production, raw
material purchasing, distribution, investment capital, and so on. In keeping with this, the role of advertising was
now seen as one of promoting growth—regular increases in sales volume. The old role of stabilising demand
became rather taken for granted. A key factor in the domination was that manufacturers could control their
consumer prices, with the full backing of the law. Wholesalers became reduced more to distributing agents. At
the same time, retailers' profit margins came under increasing pressure, with manufacturers more or less able to
dictate both their buying and selling prices.</p>

                            <p>
                                Then in the sixties this manufacturer domination began to wane, and retailers began to redress the balance of
power. They got new managements who saw the profit opportunities and themselves started using economies of
scale—in buying, warehousing, store size and location, self-service. They started taking initiatives as
entrepreneurs—branding goods like cheese, meat and vegetables; and introducing new products like
delicatessen. Of course, a key factor in all this was the ending of Resale Price Maintenance. One effect was that
of increasing the concentration within the retail trade, as marginal or specialist retailers were forced out of
business. And, of course, more immediately the retailer gained much greater control over buying and selling
prices—a means of applying his increased power.
                            </p>

<p>So is today a return to the situation the manufacturer was in during the period of wholesaler domination in the
late nineteenth century? In many ways it is. I think it is clear that in the 1970's retailers will concentrate still more.
There will be more big mergers. There will be increasing pressure on retailers' margins, through conventional
competition, through the competition of other forms of selling, such as discount stores, mail order and direct
selling, through rising costs in an inevitably labour-intensive business, and so on. Retailers will undoubtedly
pass on these pressures to manufacturers, and the fourth, fifth and sixth brands in any market will find it
increasingly tough going. Ultimately some balance will be reached. The public will demand more variety. There
might ultimately be legislation, but it seems more likely to be a Monopolies Commission type restricting the
growth of an individual chain than anything on the lines of Robinson Patman. In fact, I think it will be the retailers
themselves who will set the limit. After all, they need strong brands. The problem for manufacturers is that they
do not need very many strong brands.</p>

<p>In other words I think one must see that the 1970's as being a continuation of the trends in the 1960's. The
question the manufacturer must ask is not how to stop them, but how to exploit them. This is where it is useful to
look at history. The manufacturer broke away from wholesale domination before. Can he do it again? I believe
that he can, and that the principles by which he did it can be applied again. But there are certain crucial changes
in the context which mean that the approach will have to be rather different from the nineteenth-century
approach and very different from the approach in recent years.</p>
