                            <blockquote>First, I cannot see increased economies of scale helping the manufacturer as much as in the first half of this
century. This is not to say that all factories have fully exploited economies of scale or that there will be no totally
new production process. But on the whole, in most industries, production has already reached the size where
plant utilisation matters more to profits than scale per se. Secondly, the manufacturer's link with the consumer in
the nineteenth century was based on product reliability, guaranteed quality, Today I think that this is largely
taken for granted by the public, even with private label goods. Consumer protection legislation will make it more
so. And thirdly, I doubt if there is any real prospect of the manufacturer regaining the direct control of prices that
he had up to the 1960's. </blockquote>

<p>So in these changed circumstances how will he break away from middleman-domination, as he did before? How
is he going to sustain and increase his profits? The two methods that were most potent for him in the past are
not, I think, going to be so potent in the future. Obviously, production efficiency and sheer volume will continue
to be vital to profits—but they are unlikely to offer the means for sustained growth. Unless the manufacturer can
retain and increase his control of margins indirectly, pressure from retailers will attack his profits in a way that
simply building sales volume will not be able to offset.</p>

<p>This is really a new situation which has been creeping up on manufacturers over the last ten years. In fact, I
think that they have often been able to ignore it by the device of putting special discounts as a lump sum into the
marketing budget, as if they were a form of marketing expenditure, like advertising or competitions. This may be
an administrative convenience, but I think it is a totally false way of looking at them and one that is potentially
very dangerous. The truth is that discounts are not expenditure at all. They are income foregone. They are a
purely notional way of expressing the fact that the manufacturer's selling price is no longer fixed, that the price
he can get from a big customer is less than from a small one. This may seem a rather theoretical point, but I
believe that it is very important indeed. It has led to many false diagnoses. The real truth is that, when special
discounts have to be made bigger and bigger, the brand is simply not valuable enough in the retailer's eyes. And
yet so often the manufacturer's solution has been to cut back on those very things that would make the brand
more valuable. And so he goes into a vicious spiral. It is a vicious spiral that could be critically dangerous in the
economic conditions of the early 1970's.</p>

<p>So how do we improve margins indirectly? I think this new situation means a new role for marketing and
advertising.</p>

                            <p>The key to it must be, as before, the link with the consumer. In the current situation, the only leverage the
manufacturer can apply to the retailer is his relationship with the consumer. And the main element in profit
growth is going to have to lie in making his brand more valuable to the retailer, through its being more valuable
to the consumer. And that means his brand must be unique, it must have no adequate direct substitutes—
because it is in this, after all, that value lies. Sustained profit growth will only come if his brand has unique added
values. So how do brands become like that?</p>

                            <p>
                                Let us look at one market in particular—that of toilet paper—and consider the fortunes of Andrex and Delsey.
This is not because I want to tell the conventional sort of success story, which is usually over-simplified and
untrue to life. But I think we can see a number of pointers from the history of this market. It is a market where
there has been a great deal of price-cutting, many minor brands introduced and a lot of private label. Indeed it
looks like the sort of near-commodity market where private label thrives best.
                            </p>

<p>First, let us consider market shares up to 1963. You can see that Andrex and Delsey together steadily built up
the soft toilet paper market, against the old type of hard paper. Andrex led the way, but Delsey was not all that
far behind. In 1961, soft paper sales looked attractive enough to tempt in other manufacturers, who grew fairly
rapidly up to 1963—and became a real threat to Bowater-Scott and Kimberly Clark. So of course was the
growing pressure from retailers which accompanied these smaller cheaper brands. But from this point the two
major manufacturers diverged in their response.</p>

<p>Now, I do not think that objectively the standards of the two physical products have diverged all that much. They
have both always been of very high quality. Nor do I think people have suddenly thought to themselves “Delsey
isn't as soft as it was.” What has happened is that, relative to Andrex, people simply value Delsey a little less
highly than they did, as a brand. These words are simply their way of expressing Delsey's lower value and
Andrex's higher value to them. So where does this added value come from?</p>

<p>I think that pretty clearly the success of Andrex has been due to a blend of a lot of things. First of all, consistently
high product quality and efficient marketing. Then Andrex's early leadership in soft toilet paper and its leadership
in innovations and product improvements—the positive approach. But the added values—the factor that allows
Andrex to command a proper price—must certainly depend a good deal on the way in which the company has
used advertising. Or to broaden that a little, the consistent way in which Andrex and its values have been
presented to the public as a brand. Andrex has been very much a brand, not an object. And it is in this that I am
sure the difference lies. The next newsletter will illustrate the point by looking at some of the Andrex advertising over
the past twelve years.</p>
